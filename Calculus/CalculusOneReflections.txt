Functions and Limits

What is a function? Does not get directly answered ... instead we are shown what a function does:
Aside: What is a number? (Like '4')
        It's a name used to count any collection that can show a one to one correspondence with any set that also has that name representing its cardinality 
        (Like 'four' (4) {a,gg,d,jjj} (as an example)
        
A function assigns to each number in its domain another number.
E.G. f(x) = y where x is a number in f's domain.
NOTE: This is read 'f of x is y'
Another definition -- a functions expresses a relationship between dependent quantities. (Great Courses)

If we say f(x) = x^2 then we are saying that the function f squares f's argument. E.G. F(3) = 3^2 = 9

The domain is all numbers for which the rule (function) makes sense ... this can be narrowed for some purposes as in
  limiting the domain to all positive integers greater than 100 (for example)
 
Example: f(x) = 1/x ... here the domain cannot include the value zero (0)

NOTE: Given a function f, it is true that if f(a) = b and f(a) = c then b = c
        if that is not true then f is not by definition a function
=====================================================================================================================================
I took a week to watch the 'Great Courses: Change in Motion: Calculus Part 1 (& Part 2)' The following notes come from that course.
  I cannot recommend this course for any trying to get a serious discussion of calculus with any clarity or rigor ... there were many
  digressions that were only loosely connected ... the speaker 'uh'ed repeated words and phrases and often stopped mid sentence and 
  reversed or changed the direction of thought. While there were some interesting digressions, I don't feel this would be a useful
  expenditure of time ... unless of course you're bored.
  
Paradox: a situation that can be observed from two different points of view which lead to opposite conclusions about that situation
Example: Zeno's Paradox in Motion 
   An archer fires an arrow and the arrow moves through the air towards its destination and then strikes it;s target.
   Yet at any given instant it is can only be in place at a time so that if we observe it at exactly one instant it is clearly not moving.
   Yet is is also true that the arrow does travel a distance proportional to the time it is in the air.
    The arrow at some infinitely small time does travel through an infinitely small distance.
 
A mathematical model is an abstract relationship that corresponds to reality in an effective way. (If the model is a correct model)

A Graph describes or viualizes relationships between varying quantities. (Think cartesian graph)

Two fundamental Ideas of Calculus (NOTE: both rely on the concept of the limit (discussed after these two.)
  1) Derivative -- a way of measuring instantaneous change
    Deals with the rate at which something changes in order to determine the rate of change occuring at some instance of change.
    A common example is studying an object moving in space (at first usually a straight line) with a non constant speed.
    Two examples:
       Object is moving at a constant rate of change say 1 mile per minute (mpm). Let's say that p(t) is the position at time t
       Then p(t) = t. IE. if we observe a ball moving for 5 minutes then it has traveled 5 miles during that 5 minutes.
       We can say that the ball has a speed of (p(t) - p(0))/t; which in this case means ball is averageing 5 mpm (5 mile - 0 mile)/5 minute = 1 mpm
       Object is moving at a rate that changes as time increase.
         Say: p(t) = t^2
       If we examine the object we can calculate the average speed as before, but what if we want to know how fast the ball is moving at a specific
       time? The idea is to look at the object's average speed between the moment we are interested in and some very small moment later. Then the
       average speed is (p(t+delta{t}) - p(t))/delta{t}) (NOTE: delta{t} is nomenclature and not some kind of function call and represents some infinitesmilly
       small value of 't' (in this case)
       Doing the algebra this becomes (t+delta{t})^2 - t^2)/delta{t} (NOTE: delta{t} is not zero!)
       This becomes (t^2 + 2*delta{t}*t + delta{t}^2 - t^2)/delta{t} -->
                    (2*t*delta{t} + delta{t}^2)/delta{t} -->
                    2t + delta{t} --> which as delta{t} gets smaller and smaller looks more and more like 2t (if delta{t} became 0)
       This calculated the derivitive of t^2 nomencalture f'(t) or in this case where p(t) = t^2 ==> p'(t) = 2t
       
  2) Integral -- the accumulation of small pieces that add up to an object
     Deals with calculations like determining the area under a curve like, using the above example
     Suppose we know the instantaneous speeds (and their associated moments) while traveling along a road 
       but we want to know the distance actually travelled.
     We would sum the distances traveled in ever decreasing time intervals.
     We know, in this case, that the velocity (instantaneous) is v(t) = 2t
     then the distance is the summation of of all the small distances covered (with better aproximations as the time intervals get smaller and smaller.
     Integral(n, 0, t, v(n) = 2n) --> sum(n,0,t, v(n*delta{t})*delta{t}) divided by delta{t}

The derivitive and the integral are closely related as inverses but are not true inverses. Given an integral of a function; An antiderivitive is a function
  that when the derivitive of that functions is found gives us the given integral. Antiderivitives are not unique. So 2t is the derivitive of t^2 and t^2 is an
  antiderivitive of 2t, but the integral of 2t is (t^2 + C) where C is some Constant value.

Derivitive is the tangent to the given line of a curve (it is the slope of the tangent to that curve)

The mean value theorem for derivitives -- there is some moment in time your instantaneous speed will be exactly equal to the avergae time.

(delta{}/delta{t})(t^2) = 2t (Lebniz's notation for the derivitive ...)
or
P(t) = t^2
P'(t) = 2t

Derivitives measure the rate of change of one quantity with respect to another quantity

Given the square (as an example) area = x^2 we can ask the question how fast does the area grow as we increase the side of a square
  ((x+delta{x})^2 - x^2)/delta{x} is the formula representing this question.
  Notice similarity between (P(t+delta{t}) - P(t))/delta{t}

The circle area = pi*r^2
  (A(r+delta{r}) - A(r))/delta{r}. In fact A'(r) = (delta{}/delta{r})(pi * r^2) = 2*pi*r

If we put a belt on the earth so that is fit tight (matched the circumference) and then made the belt six feet longer how much space would
  there be between the earth and the belt.

What is the change in the radius when we change the circumference
C(r) = 2*pi*r
C'(r) = 2*pi

Easy derivitives:
P(t) = C*t (C is a constant)
P'(t) = C

P(t) = t^2
  ((t + delta{t})^2 - t^2)/delta{t} = (t^2 + 2*t*delta{t} + delta{t}^2 = t^2)/delta{t} ==>
  ((2*t*delta{t}) + delta{t}*2)/delta{t} = 2t + delta{t} so (delta{}/delta{t})(t^2) = 2t

extending and generalizing f(x) = C*x^2 --> f'(x) = 2*C*x and still further f(x) = C*x^N --> f'(x) = f'(x) = N*C*x^(N-1)

and as sums f(x) = 5x^3 + 2x + 3 --> f'(x) = 15x^2 + 2

Using sine function
Note: given a unit circle (with radius 1), draw two radii, measure the angle between them and call that angle theta ... then draw a line from the intersection of one radius and the cicumference of the circle
  to the other radius such that the angle formed at that intersection is 90 degrees then the length of that line from one radius to the other is sine theta
  Cos theta is the length of the line along the radius to the intersection of sine theta and the radius it is perpendicular to.
  
What is the change of sin theta when we change theta.

(sin (theta + delta theta) - sin(theta)) / delta theta =  cos theta

(d/d theta)(sin theta) = cos theta
(d/d theta) (cos theta) = -sin theta

Finding the Integral of a curve is also finding the area under a curve.

Notation Intergral from 0 to 3 2t dt (delta t) ... Elongated letter S with subscript start of range and superscript end of range
the 2t dt is (the 2t is the rectangle formula for a problem (could be something else) the dt (delta t) represents a tiny width (dimension of time)

The fundamental Theorem of Calculus: Integral from a to b(F'(x) dx) = F(b) - F(a) try this, since no elongated S with sub/super script available to me in NotePad++
   Integrate(a, b, F'(x) dx) = F(b) - F(a)
   
Finally talking about limit
a limit is ...
the limit as x approaches 2 of the function ((x^2)-4)/(x-2) is the value that the function approaches (converges on) as x gets closer and closer to 2

Definition of the limit:
limit as x approaches c of f(x) = l
lim(x,c,f(x)) = l
For all epsilon greater than zero, there exists a lower case delta greater than zero such that if
  the absolute value of (x - c) < lower case delta, then the absolute value of (f(x) - l) < epsilon
so now (finally)
delta{}/delta{x}(x^2) = lim(delta{x}, 0, (((x+delta{x})^2)-(x^2))/(delta{x}))

Dedekind Cuts ... if you can find a value that separates two sections of the number line (such that the value is not a number)
   call that value a number so that the separation does not exist ... I think I need to think about this and give a better definition that
   is clearer.

Solving summations of infinite series:

Example: when does the minute hand and the hour hand line up? (the example as shown had the clock reading 4 o'clock.
given that the hour hand moves at 1/12 the speed of the minute hand.

Then (reminding us of achelles and the tortoise) when the minute hand moves to where the hour hand is that would be 20 minutes
  the hour hand has moved 20/12 minutes ... and (the minute hand is trying to catch the hour hand) when the minute hand has moved 20/12 more
  the hour hand has moved 20/(12^2) ... and as the minute hand moves to catch up again
  the hour hand has moved 20/(12^3) ...
Can be phrased as:
   M = 20 + 20/12 + 20/(12^2) + 20/(12^3)+ 20/(12^4) ...
to solve:
divide both sides by 12:
M/12 =      20/12 + 20/(12^2) + 20/(12^3)+ 20/(12^4) ...
(note how it essentially shifts the values (in a visual sense) one space to the right)
the subtract the new expression from the original
M - M/12 = 20 (all the fractions cancel)
11/12 M = 20
M = 20&9/11

This also shows how repeating decimal expansions can be stated as Rational numbers as well.

Note to self about Newton-Raphson Approximation ... if you want to know the value at a particular place in a curve
the example was the curve generated by (x^2)-5 (which has as an x-intercept the square root of five) the idea is to make a guess at the value
plug that value into f(x) ((x^2)-5) and then calulate the slope at that point (derivitive --> f'(x) = 2x)
calculate the point at which the line for that slope crosses the x-axis to get our second guess
repeat until we have a sufficiently accurate approximation ... NOTE: this converges vey quickly (at least in this example which gives 9 accurate
digit after three iterations)
=====================================================================================================================================================
Back to the Udacity course
What is a limit?
To say that limit(x,a,f(x)) = L says that f(x) can be made as close to L as desired by making x close enough to a.

Fact: near the sum of two numbers is the sum of  two nearby numbers

Facts: limit(x,a,f(x) + g(x)) = limit(x,a,f(x)) + limit(x,a,g(x))
  limit of sums is equal to sum of limits (given limits exist)
        limit(x,a,f(x)*g(x)) = limit(x,a,f(x))*limit(x,a,g(x))
  limit of product is equal to product of limits (again provided limits exist)
        limit(x,n,x) = n
  limit of a value as it approaches a value is that value (could be better phrased I think)
  
Using this : what is the limit(x,2,x^2+x) ==> limit(x,2,x^2)+limit(x,2,x) ==> limit(x,2,x)*limit(x,2,x) + 2 ==> 2*2 + 2 ==> 6

What is limit(x,0,sin(1/x))? NOTE: THIS LIMIT DOES NOT EXIST!!
What about f(x) = sin(pi/x)? Apparently this DNE (Does Not Exist) as well
What about f(x) = sin(x)/x? What is limit(x,0,sin(x)/x)?

Given cos(x) < sin(x)/x < 1 when x is close to 0 ... this is stated as given fact
limit(x,0,cos(x)) = 1 Note: cos(x) is continuous so we can eval at 0 to show it is 1
limit(x,0,1) = 1 ... sort of obvious

Use 'Squeeze Theorem' which states
if g(x) <= f(x) <= h(x) for values of x near a
and limit(x, a, g(x)) = limit(x, a, h(x)) = L
then limit(x, a, f(x)) = L

So limit(x,0,sin(x)/x) = 1

Other useful stuff limit(x,0,sin(-4x)/-7x) = 4/7
  Note: limit(x,0,sin(-4x)/-7x) == limit(x,0, ((4/7)*sin(-4x))/((4/7)*-7x)) == limit(x,0,((4/7)*sin(-4x))/-4x) == (4/7)*limit(x,0,sin(-4x)/-4x) because limit of products is product of limits and lim(x,a,C) is C
    ==> 4/7 because sin(-4x)/-4x is sin(y)/y and the limit(x,0,sin(y)/y) is 1 as shown above
    
What about limit(x,1,((x^2)-1)/(x-1))? Note: as long as x != 1 then ((x^2)-1)/(x-1) = x + 1 which means that (as far as I can tell from example)
  that limit(x,1,((x^2)-1)/(x-1)) = limit(x, 1, (x+1)) = limit(x,1,x) + limit(x,1,1) = 1 + 1 = 2
  This works because of the definition which states that we are not making x = a but instead are saying it is a close as we want to a

Difference of limits = limit of differences provided the limits exist
Division of limits = limit of divisors provided the limits exist AND the denominator limit is not zero
Let's try limit(x,2,((x^2)/(x+1))) ==> limit(x,2,x^2)/limit(x, 2, x -1) ==> (limit(x,2,x)*limit(x,2,x))/(limit(x,2,x)-limit(x,2,1) ==> (2*2)/(2-1) ==> 4/1 ==> 4
  
More on limits:
limit(x,a+, f(x)) = L means that f(x) is as close as you want to L provided x is near enough to a on the right.
limit(x,a-, f(x)) = L means that f(x) is as close as you want to L provided x is near enough to a on the left.
if limit(x,a+,f(x)) != limit(x,a-,f(x)) then limit(x,a,f(x)) DNE.
if limit(x,a+,f(x)) == limit(x.a-,f(x)) == L then limit(x,a,f(x)) = L.

Continuity:
Morally, "f(x) is continuous at a" means that inputs near a are sent to outputs near f(a).
Looks like f(x) = squareroot(x) is continuous at 2.
To say that "f(x) is continuous at a" means that limit(x,a,f(x)) = f(a).
  must be able to say f(x) is defined at x = a.
  lim(x,a,f(x)) must exist.
  
To say that "f(x) is continuous on the "open" interval (a,b)" means that, for all points c so that a < c < b, f(x) is continuous at c.
To say that "f(x) is continuous on the "closed" interval [a,b]" means that f(x) is continuous on the open interval (a, b) and
  that limit(x,a+,f(x)) = f(a) and 
  that limit(x,b-,f(x)) = f(b).
  
Intermediate Value Theorem
Suppose:
  f(x) is continuous on [a,b], and
  y is between f(a) and f(b).
Then
  there is an x between a and b so that f(x) = y.
