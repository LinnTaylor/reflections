Largely a course on game theory ... not clear at this time if it's an MBA course/economic course or a game theory course
Important things to know (the ones that matter .. number of players, actions each player can take, payoffs on each action/player, and rules (simultaneous/ turn etc.)

Dominant strategy is a strategy that always pays more than other strategies regardless of other players actions.
  if there is a dominant strategy then it is clear what will happen ... choose that strategy and the opponent's will choose their strategies knowing what you will do.
Dominated strategy is a strategy that always pays less then other strategies regardless of other playe's actions.
  eliminate dominated strategies one at a time until either it is clear what all opponents will do or until their are no more dominated strategies left to eliminate.
  
Nash Equilibrium -- no player can choose a strategy that will increase their payoffs.
  a nash equilibrium is a combination of strategies such that no player can deviate unilaterally from their current strategy to improve their payoffs.
  
Prisoners Dilemma -- a situation where the best strategies of the players leads to payoffs that are less than other strategies but niether player has an incentive
  to choose the other(s) strategy.
                player B
  player A    | Advertise | Don't
    Advertise |  2.5\2.5  | 5.5 \ 2.0
        Don't |  2.0\5.5  | 5.0 \ 5.0

        A's payoff\B's payoff

Not a problem of information .. the players know the table ... but both players act selfishly without communication with each other ... result does not maximize joint payoffs

The above holds for simultaneous decisions but not for sequential decisions ... use a tree instead

Backward induction ...eleimate actions at final node and work up the tree
choose actions that do not maximize the choice makers payoff at each point and remove that/those actions

Had some problems with Quiz .. related to sloppy ready and in-attention to procedure ... my bad took several takes to get 9/10 ... still bothered about
question 7 ...

table:
  5\5 2\6
  6\2 3\x
  what values of x make this a prisoners dilemma? I think this means that ...
    if a choose action 1 (payoff 5 from 5\5) then b will choose action 2 (payoff 6 from 2\6) then a would choose action 2 (payoff 3 of 3\x) then b
      b would choose action 1 ... scratch this
  action 1 is dominated for a (5\5 2\6 is less than 6\2 3\6)
  if x>2 then same applies to b (5\5 6\2 is less than 2\6 3\x)
     so nash will be 3\x
  and 5\5 is better than 3\x but without trust\cooperation the players will go for 3\x
  
  if x >= 5 then 3/x is still the better choice but even with trust/cooperation b would have no motivation to change so not prisoners dilemma
     got it this one had a subtley in definition I missed until I knew answer and thought it through (DOH!)
