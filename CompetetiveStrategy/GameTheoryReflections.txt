Interesting Game --- prisoners deilemma that I can relate to ... very cool
Two Player
Both have same choices. To use a Correct TCP or a Defective TCP
Both Correct -> Both Experience a 1ms delay in communications
Both Defective -> Both Experience a 3ms delay
A Defects and B Correct -> A experiences no delay while B gets a 4ms delay
A Coorect and B Defects -> A gets a 4ms delay while B experiences no delay

Cute

Self interested agent does not mean that they want to harm others or that they care only about themselves but that the agent
  has its own description of states of the world that it likes, and will act based on this description
  
Each agent has a utility function that quantifies degree of preference over lternatives, explains the impact of uncertainty, and
  has a decision-theoretic rationality (acts to maximize the expected utility)
  
Untility:
  Why is a single dimensional function sufficient?
  Why should the response to uncertainty by captured by an expected value?
  
Famous theorem by von Neumann & Morgenstern that derives the existance of a utility function from a more basic preference ordering and
  axioms on such orderings.
  
Key Ingredients:
Players: (The Decision Makers)
Actions: (What actions can players take (what are their options))
Payoffs: (What is players motivation ... what do they get interm of their utility function)

Two representations for defining games
Normal Form: Also called Matrix Form and Strategic Form
  (for two players this is a matrix with rows representing actions of one player and columns actions of the others

Extensive Form (for two players this is a tree with alteranting players choices listed at each node

Matrix Form used for games where players make choices Simultaneously
Extensive Form when players act react in turn

Finite n person Normal Form is <N, A, u>
Players: N = {1...n} a finite n indexed with i
Action Set for Player i is A sub i where a = (a sub 1, ... a sub n) is an element of A sub i X ... A sub n ((a is an 'action profile'))
Utility Function or Payoff function for player i called u sub i (it maps A to Reals)
  u = (u sub 1, ..., u sub n) is profile of utility functions
  
Games with two players can be shown with matrix form is simultaneous

But a game with 10,000,000 players

Suppose a population of 10,000,000 can (each player) choose to revolt or not
Further suppose that you need at least 2,000,000 to choose revolt in order for a revolution to occur
Let the utility be
get a reward of 1 if 2,000,000 choose to revolt (regardless of whether you chose to revolt or not)
get a reward of -1 if less than 2,000,000 choose to revolt and you chose to revolt
get a reward of 0 if less than 2,000,000 choose to revolt and you did not choose to revolt (chose not)
 note that in this case the question is related to participation ie payoff depends on others as well as self
 
While Normal form we need Players, Actions, and Payoffs
In Extensive Form we may also need Timing of decisions and Information Known at time of decision-theoretic

Cool Prisoner's dilemma is an two player two action game
a,a b,c
c,b d,d
where c > a > d > b
I knew there was a relationship stance that could define some (all?) games.

Games of pure competion (Players have exactly opposed interests)
Must be two and only two players
for all action profiles the sum of the utility functions = a constant (with the special case being zero-sum
so we only need to track one players utility function
simple example matching heads/tails one player wants to match the other wants to mismatch

        heads   tails
heads     1,-1   -1,1
tails     -1,1   1,-1

generalized match pennies
          rock    paper   scissors   
rock        0,0    -1,1     1,-1
paper       1,-1   0,0      -1,1
scissors    -1,1   1,-1     0,0

Games of cooperation: players have exactly the same interests
no conflict
For all action profiles For all i and j u sub i of action = u sub j of action
only need single payoff per cell
  which side of rode to drive on (left or right)
     left    right
left  1,1     0,0
right  0,0     1,1


Mixed of above 
Battle of the sexes going to see movie together (Action or Romantic)
      A       R
A   2,1     0,0
R    0,0     1,2


Nash Equilibria
Keynes Beauty Contest Game
You hold a stock and the stock price is rising
You believe that the price is too high to be justified by the value of the company
You want to sell but you would like to wait until the price is almost at peak
You want to get out of market before the other investors do
Stylized version of this game:
Keynes proposed a beuty contest where you have to decide who others will think will win a beuty contest
Each player can choose a number between (inclusive) 1 and 100 (integer)
Players will move simultaneously
The player who names the integer closest to two thirds of the average integer wins a prize everyone else gets nothing
Ties will be broken by random selection

So thinking what other players are thinking I want to guess 2/3 of X
Bu X cannot be bigger that 100 so I should guess 67
But I know that all players will think this so I need to guess 2/3 of 67
But I know that all players will know this as well so I should guess 2/3 of 2/3 of 67
And so on till I hit One so I vote 1 so does all others and winner is randomly selected
1, in this case is nash equilibria
Is Not the game gets played largely because some players do not understand the nature of the game or misunderstand the evaluation of the game

Nash Equalibrium assumes
A Consistent list of actions
Each players action maximizes their payoff given the actions of others
Self consistent or stable
No one has an incentive to deviate from their chosen action (if they do it is not a Nash Equilibrium)

Your Best Response is an action such that this action yields a highr payoff that any other action you could take given the others actions remain the same.
So A NAsh Equilibrium is a set of actions such that for all players no other action would give a better payoff given that the other players don not change
  their action.
  
Domoniant\Dominated
A Strategy (Pure Strategy is choice of action)

Strictly Dominating Strategy a strategy that is always better than any other regardless of what other players choose
Weakly Dominating is a strategy that is at least as good (greater than or equal to) an other regardless of what other players do
If every player has a dominant strategy than that Action set is a nash equilibrium and it will be unique (if all strategies Strictly Dominant)

Pareto Optimality ??? first time I've heard of this
Previous conversations have been about evaluating from the perspective of a player
Now we will look at games from outside (ie we are not players) Is there a sense in which we can say that some outcomes are better than others?
  we cannot say that one persons interests are better than anothers
   and we don't know the currency of each players outcomes
So let's say that some outcome set for some action set is at least as good as any other outcome for every player and at least on player this
  outcome strictly dominates all other of their outcomes
Then we can say that that outcome Pareto Dominates (ie that is a better outcome than some others
  Not all games have this feature
 An outcome set is Pareto Optimal if it is not Pareto Dominated by any other outcome
  this means that there may be multiple Pareto Optimal outcome sets
Hmmm every game must have at least one pareto optimal outcome .... need to think on this would be nice to see a complete example
Ahhh Pareto Optimal says there is nothing that dominates it if there could be no Pareto Optimal then each outcome would have to be dominated (strictly)
  which can't happen ... somebody is on top.
Examples
    left    right
 Left 1,1 0,0
 Right 0,0 1,1
 --> LeftLeft and RightRight are both pareto optimal
 Like Wise in battle of sexes AA and RR are both pareto optimal
 Penny Matching all are pareto optimal (in general zero-sum games all are Pareto Optimal
 In Prisoner;'s dilemma all but the defectdefect are pareto optimal
   defect defect is not because it is pareto dominated by cooperate cooperate
 The parodox of the Prisoner's dilemma is that the Strictly Dominated Nash Equilibrium Strategy (defect defect) is the only non Pareto Optimal
  (ie the best strategy by the players does not give the best outcome from an outsiders (nonplayers) perspective)
