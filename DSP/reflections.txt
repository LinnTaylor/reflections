I'm looking forward to learning how to really use Audacity.

I'm wondering if I'll use Sonic Visualizer after this class expecially given I acqure the knowledge to implement these task myself.
  Need (maybe) to get more VAMP plugins.
  
Info I need to get solid with:

Sinusoidal Functions (SineWaves)

  x[n] = A*cos(omega*n*T + phi) = A * cos(2*pi*frequency*n*T + phi)
where:
  A = the amplitude of the sine wave
  omega (lower case) = angular frequency in radians
  frequency = omega / (2 * pi) = frequency in Hertz
  phi (lower case) = initial phase in radians
  n = time index
  T  = 1/frequency = sampling period in seconds (t = nT = n/(frequency sub s)
  
that is straight from notes from lecture ... the picture I have of above is fairly clear but not 100%

Complex Numbers

  a + jb --> j = root(2, -1) a,b both elements of the real numbers 
    above is the rectangular form can be represented on cartesian graph using a as x coordinate (the Real axis) and b as y coordinate (Complex axis)
    
  can also be represented in Polar form as a vector that begins at the origin (0) with a magnitude (length) A = root(2, a^2 + b^2) and an angle of displacemtn
    from the positive real axis phi (lower case) = tan inverse(b/a)
    the polar form can make addition and multiplication more intuitive
    
Euler's Formula

  raise(e,j*phi) = cos(phi) + j*sin(phi)  (can draw this using a unit circle such that magnitude = 1/frequency
  
  cos(phi) = (raise(e,j*phi) + raise(e,-j*phi))/2
  sin(phi) = (raise(e,j*phi) - raise(e,-j*phi))/(2*j)
  
Complex Sine wave

  (x bar)[n] = A*raise(e,j*(omega*n*T+phi) = A*raise(e,phi)*raise(e,j*(omega*n*T) = X*raise(e, j*(omega*n*T)
    (X = A*raise(e,phi))
             = A*cos(omega*n*T + phi) + j*sin(omega*n*T + phi)
             
Real Sine wave
  x[n] = A*cos(omega*n*T + phi) = A*((raise(e,j*(omega*n*T+phi)) + raise(e, -j*(omega*n*T + phi)))/2)
       = (1/2)*X*raise(e, j(omega*n*T)) + (1/2)*(X star)*raise(e,-j*omega*n*T = (1/2)(x bar)[n] + (1/2)(x bar star)[n]
       = Reals of set with (x bar)[n] s (will be converting Complex to Reals)

Scalar (Dot Product) product of sequences
  <x,y> = sum(n,0,N-1, x[n]*(y bar)[n])  does (y bar) indicate conjugate???
  Example: x = [0,j,1] and y = [1, j, j]
     <x,y> = 0*-1 + j*-j + 1*-j = 0 + 1 + -j = 1 - j
     
     x orthoganal y means <x,y> = 0 (I recall this from linear algebra)
     
     if x = [2,2] and y = [2,-2] then <x,y> = 2*-2 + 2*2 = 4-4 = 0 so x orthoganal y
     
     so yes, in this case (y bar) is conjugate of y!!!
     
Even and Odd Functions
  F(n) is even if F(-n) = F(n) .... symetrical about origin
  F(n) is odd if F(-n) = -F(n) .... antisymetric example showed rotational symetry a sine wave with phi not equal zero
    cosine is even and sine is odd
    
Convolution (here I may be in trouble for a bit)

   y[n] = (x sub 1)[n] * (x sub 2)[n])sub n = sum(m,0,N-1,(x sub 1)[n]*(x sub 2)[N-m])
     similar to cross cerrelation (so he says) ... did not follow this well at all
