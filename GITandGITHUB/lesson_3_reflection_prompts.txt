When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    Whenever I wanted to be able to access file from any location not just one that contained a working copy.
    Also would be useful as a central repository for multiple authors.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    I can be working on some changes that may be overwritten by an automatic pull.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?
    Branch: gives two separate commit path that are connected by some earlier commits
						correct choice if the branches share a common functionality that, if updated, needs to be reflected in all branches that occur after that commit
		Clone: gives a copy of an entire repository, this is useful for backing up, for acquiring a project that will/might be significantly altered and it is desired that no changes affect others
						you might do this instead of branching if you intend to use data in repository for a project that is separate from project that repositry was built for
		Fork: GITHub only, same as clone but enforces ownership of repository being cloned, useful for licensing purposes.
