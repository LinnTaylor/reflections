accuracy = number of correct 'hits' divided by total number of 'hits'

Bayes' Rule
Example (generalized)
P(C) --> percent cancer appears in population (chance individual has cancer) = 0.01
Test = 90% it is positive if you have cancer (this is the sensitivity) (IE it reports correctly that you do have cancer 90% of the time) P(Pos|C)
				sensitivity = number of true positives divided by the sum of the number of true positives plus the number of false negatives
										= number of true positives divided by the number of sick people in population
										= probability of a positive test, given that patient is ill. P(Pos|C)
       90% it is negative if you don't have cancer (this is the specitivity) (IE it reports correctly that you don't have cancer 90% of the time) P(Neg|~C)
				seems to be some conflict between the word specitivity and specificity ... the udacity course uses the former while I belive the later si the correct word
				there are a few other times in medical papers that specitivity is used but in all case I found it appeared to be a misuse/malaproprism of sorts
				specificity = number of false negatives divided by the sum of the number of true negatives plus the number of false positives
										= number of false negatives divided by the total number of healthy people in population
										= probability of a negative test given the patient is healthy. P(Neg|~C)
Bayes Rule
	Prior Probability * Test Result --> Posterior Probability
Prior:
	P(C) = 0.01
		P(~C) = 0.99
		P(Pos|C) = 0.90
		P(Pos|~C) = 0.10
		P(Neg|~C) = 0.90
Posterior:
	Get Joint Probabilities
	P(C,Pos) --> chance an individual has cancer given that they were tested positive
		= P(C) * P(Pos|C)
		= 0.01 * .9 = 0.009
	P(~C,Pos) -->
		= P(~C) * P(Pos|~C)
		= 0.99 * 0.10 = 0.099
Normalizing
		P(Pos) = P(C,Pos) + P(~C,Pos) = 0.108
		P(C|Pos) = P(C,Pos) / P(Pos) = 0.009/0.108 = 0.083333...
		P(~C|Pos) = P(~C,Pos) / P(Pos) = 0.099/0.108 = 0.916666...
