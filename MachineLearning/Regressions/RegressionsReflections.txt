Okay so if we constrain the output to a dichotomous answer (boolean yes or no ... o or 1 ... etc.)
  this is a Discrete classifier
  
On the other hand if we were training to guess weight given height this would be a continous classifier

In general if there is an ordering of theoutput data ie two consecutive value have a relationship that orders them then
  the classifier is continous 
and if there are multiple choices for output classification but they have no ordering then
  the classifier is discrete ... so guessing phone number given name is discrete as is guessing whether it will be sunny cloudy or raining
  
LinearRegression
Note structure of coef_
and of intercept_ -- they both need [] with index (coef_ needs[][]) ... just look at structure
score returns r-squared metric .. higher is better ... used on test data ... can get for training data as validator
