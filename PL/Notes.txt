complex made of a number

variable identifiers optional underscore followed by a letter followed by letters, digits, or underscore
variables are undefined if they are used or defined without being given an initial value

a tuple is () an empty tupple (k) a tuple with a single value or (g,b..) with a n-size equal to the number of commas + 1
assert will assert a tupple where all elements are defined or constant
query will return a tupple containing the results bound to any undefined variables in tupple used as argument to query
  subsequent calls will continue search from last query
  a null tupple () is returned if no such bindings exist

a function is an identifier followed by a tuplecontaining the arguments the function uses uses
the definition of a function (all calls are functions)
defun identifier tupple pre/in/post pre is default

collction types 
sets {0 or more comma seperated items} ... sets contain no duplicates and are unordered (can be iterated but not guarenteed to get same order from multiple iterators)
tupples (0 or more comma separated items) ... tupples may contain dupplicates and are ordered by position can be indexed and iterated with ordering preserved
arrays [0 or more comma separated items] ... arrays may contain duplicates and can be ordered by items can be indexed and sorted iteration oreder prserved
  arrays can have multiple dimensions table[][] for 2d example cube[][][] for three conspetually its column row depth etc.

defclass identifier is identifier

  public functions
  
valid lines of example code

defvar temple
defvar balls as 15
defvar names as "Tom Trible"
defvar colours as {red, blue, green}

equality
equals(a, b) # they have same value
sameas(a, b) # identical objects (they refer to same object)
similar(a, b) # value is same and belong to same class

all objects
 have string representation (print knows what to do)
 have a value (this includes undefined)

Numbers
  undefined, not a number, ifinite big and infinte small, immutable
  can be added subtracted multiplied divided and modulus and remainder

Strings
  can be searched, printed, concated, and subsetted, and iterated, immutable
  
Arrays can be indexed sorted and iterated and mutable

Tuples can be indexed and iterated immutable

Sets can be iterated and add and remove and subsetted immutable

isa this item has same behavior as named class
