This contains information to aid me in remembering and reinforcing concepts and facts I've discovered in various explorations.

Whether you, the ourside peruser, will find anything useful here is as much a statement of your curiosity and state of mind as it is a statement of my ability to convey anything useful.
Having said that ... enjoy ... and good luck and wishes to you on your journey.

I started this as an assignment to an on-line course describing how to use GIT and GITHub. Not only did I find the class informative and the material useful but I also decided to continue the note taking reflection for other endeavours and to use GITHub as the central storage are of this to facilitate my access regardless of my location or equipment available.
This is probably the only time in any of this I will refer to 'you' as some unknown reader. I'm doing this for myself ... if it proves useful to someone else that's just additional profit.
